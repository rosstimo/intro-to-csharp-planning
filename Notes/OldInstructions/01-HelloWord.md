Create a GitHub repository

Within the repository there should be a .NET solution/project with visual basic source code.

This can be in class practice, hello world, etc.

Perform at least three commits to the repository with changes significant enough to be noticed in the source code text. (add/remove a line of code)

Push all the committed changes to the remote repository on GitHub and verify they are visible.

Submit the URL to your GitHub repository as a clickable link here.

Example:

https://github.com/rosstimo/Operators.git
