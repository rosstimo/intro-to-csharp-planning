# Assignment Instruction Conversion Process

- Refer to the `OldInstructions` directory for the original assignment instructions (VB.Net).
- For each assignment instruction, create a new markdown file in the `Notes/NewInstructions` directory.
- Use the same number prefix and assignment name for the new file (e.g., `01-HelloWorldInstructions.md`).
- The new instructions should be specifically for C# programming assignments.
- Ensure the new instructions are clear, modern, and follow the C# course style and requirements.
- As you convert, check for and remove any duplicate or incorrectly named files.
- Keep the `Notes/NewInstructions` directory organized with only the current, numbered instruction files.
