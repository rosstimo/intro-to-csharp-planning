An elementary school principal has approached you to write a program to assist teachers in administering a math contest for children:

* The form you design will allow the teacher to enter a 

  * child’s name  
  * grade  
  * age  
  * choose a math problem type (add, subtract, multiply or divide).

* Your program will verify that all of the required information on the form has been completed.

*  If any data is missing or incorrect a message box will be shown displaying the incorrect fields.

* The focus will be placed in the first field that was incorrect and the teacher can continue by correcting the errors. 

* If all student information data is correct then the requested math operation can be selected.

* New random numbers will be provided by the program each time the selected math operation is changed or the submit button is clicked.

*  The contestant will then supply the result of the calculation and click the submit button.

* If the answer submitted by the student is correct a congratulations message box will be shown.

*  If the answer is incorrect then a message box with the correct answer will be displayed. A total will be kept of all correct and incorrect responses that should be shown in a message box when the teacher clicks the summary button.

* See the following page for one possible design for the form. Notice that radio buttons are used for the teacher to choose the type of operation to be performed. 

* Select the add radio button as the default at startup and when the form is cleared.

* All fields are required. The grade must be between 1 and 4\. 

* The age must be between 7 and 11\. 

* Display “Student not eligible to compete” in a message box

* All of the numbers are integers. 

* The submit button should be the accept button (Enter)

* The clear button should be the cancel button (Esc)

* Display results properly formatted in text boxes

* Provide a label for each TextBox

* Group input text boxes in a group box

* Group output text boxes in a another group box

* Buttons:

  * SubmitButton  
  * ClearButton  
  * ExitButton

* Verify all user data and capture any and all errors

  * Alert the user with a specific message about the error(s) with:

    * MessageBox.Show("Message To User")

  * Clear the bad data and set focus to the offending textbox

  * If there are multiple errors set focus to the earliest textbox in the tab order

* Tooltips on all group boxes and buttons

* Set proper order of tab stops for all user input and controls

* Set Hot-key for each button
