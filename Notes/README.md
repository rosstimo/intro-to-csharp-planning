# Notes Directory

This directory is a workspace for course content creators, including both human contributors and AI assistants. It serves as a repository for ideas, drafts, and miscellaneous materials used in the development of the Intro to C# Programming course.

---

## Purpose

The `Notes/` directory is intended for:
- **Drafts and Outlines:** Early versions of lesson plans, assignments, or topic explanations.
- **Planning Documents:** Schedules, to-do lists, and brainstorming materials.
- **Reference Materials:** Links, notes, and resources that support course creation.
- **Legacy Content:** Older versions of instructions or materials for reference.
- **Miscellaneous Items:** Anything that doesn't yet have a permanent home in the repository.

## Directory Structure

### Root Files
- **`Schedule.md`:** A 16-week course schedule outlining topics and activities for each week.
- **`Planning.md`:** General planning notes and ideas for course development.
- **`KnownIssues.md`:** Tracks known issues and areas for improvement in the repository.
- **`TODOs.md`:** A checklist of pending tasks for course development.
- **`RCET2265.pdf`:** A reference document for course design.
- **`OldCourseContent.md`:** Legacy content from earlier iterations of the course.
- **`RepositoryReviewAndInsights.md`:** A high-level review of the repository structure, strengths, and areas for improvement.

### Subdirectories
- **`OldInstructions/`:** Contains older versions of assignment instructions, including:
  - `01-HelloWord.md` to `18-StansGrocery.md`: Drafts of assignment instructions.
  - `InstructionConversion.md`: Notes on converting instructions to the current format.

---

## Guidelines for Use

- **Work in Progress:** Use this space for drafts and experimental ideas. Perfection is not required.
- **Organize When Finalized:** Move finalized materials to the appropriate directory (e.g., `Topics/`, `Assignments/`, `StyleGuide/`).
- **Collaborate:** Share ideas and collaborate with other contributors.
- **Keep It Relevant:** Remove outdated or irrelevant files when they are no longer useful.

## Updates Based on Repository Review

The following updates have been made to align with the repository review:
1. **Added `KnownIssues.md` and `TODOs.md`:** These files now track known issues and pending tasks, ensuring all problems and work items are documented and resolved systematically.
2. **Clarified Legacy Content Usage:** Legacy files in `OldInstructions/` and `OldCourseContent.md` are for reference only. Do not copy directly into new materials; instead, use them as inspiration for updated content.
3. **Repository Review Insights:** The `RepositoryReviewAndInsights.md` file provides a high-level summary of the repository's structure, strengths, and areas for improvement. Use this as a guide for future updates.
4. **Missing Items Identified:** The repository review highlighted several gaps, including:
   - Missing quiz and assessment content.
   - Lack of a standardized grading rubric.
   - Incomplete or missing `ProjectSetup.md`.
   - Duplication of assignment instructions in multiple locations.
   - Legacy content integration and alignment with the new course structure.
   - Learning objectives missing from topic files.
   - Midterm and final assessment plans not yet developed.

## Notes for AI Assistants

- Use this directory to store drafts, experimental code, or notes that don't yet belong in the main course structure.
- Follow the repository's style and formatting rules when moving files out of `Notes/`.
- If unsure where something belongs, leave it here and ask for clarification.

## Final Word

The `Notes/` directory is a creative and collaborative space for building and refining the course. Use it freely, but remember to keep it organized and relevant to the course's goals. When in doubt, prioritize clarity and collaboration.
