# Notes (Course Planning Documents)

This directory contains high-level planning materials for the entire Intro to C# course. It is meant for **course developers** to organize the course structure and reference legacy materials. These files are **not** student-facing content, but rather the blueprints guiding content creation and sequencing.

## Contents

- **Schedule.md** – The 16-week course schedule, listing topics and activities week-by-week:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}. This is the master plan of what will be covered each week (e.g. Week 1: basics and Hello World; Week 9: intro to GUIs). Use this to ensure each week’s content and assignments align with the planned topics.
- **Planning.md** – A course development to-do list and objectives for content creation:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}. It outlines tasks like creating lesson plans, quizzes, weekly assessments, assignment instructions, a style guide, etc. Course developers should update this as tasks are completed or requirements change.
- **OldCourseContent.md** – Reference outline of the previous version of this course (in VB.NET). It includes legacy resources and an overview of weekly assignments/quizzes:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}. Use this to understand how the old course was structured. (Do **not** distribute to students; it’s for internal reference only.)
- **OldInstructions/** – Folder of **original VB.NET assignment instructions** from the old course (e.g. `02-SayMyName.md` for the “Say My Name” assignment). These serve as reference when writing new C# assignment instructions. Each file is numbered according to the old course’s assignments. **Do not edit these old instruction files** – instead, convert their content into new C# instructions elsewhere as needed.
<!-- If a NewInstructions folder were introduced, mention it here. Currently, new instructions reside in the Assignments directory. -->
- *(If applicable)* **NewInstructions/** – (May not be present.) Initially, the plan was to create this for new C# assignment instructions:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}. In the current structure, however, new assignment instructions are kept in the `Assignments/00-AssignmentInstructions` folder. Course developers should be aware of this structure to avoid confusion.

## Purpose and Best Practices

The Notes directory is the **planning hub**. It ensures a backward-design alignment for the course:
- **Big-Picture Alignment:** Always begin by checking the *Schedule.md* to understand the intended outcomes and topics for a given week. This helps you design content that meets those objectives (e.g., if Week 5 focuses on methods and loops, ensure your lessons and assignments that week target those skills).
- **Content Development Tracking:** Use *Planning.md* to guide and track content creation. It lists everything that needs to be developed (from lesson plans to style guide). Keep it updated – for example, if you complete converting an assignment or drafting a quiz, note it here. This ensures nothing is overlooked and the course materials remain coherent with each other.
- **Legacy Reference Caution:** *OldCourseContent.md* and *OldInstructions/* are there to inform how things were done previously. While creating new content, refer to these for ideas, but always update examples and instructions to modern C# and our current style. For instance, if *OldInstructions/06-MultiplicationTable.md* describes the VB version of an assignment, use it as a starting point but rewrite it entirely in C# context for the new assignment.
- **No Student Access:** Remember that files in Notes are for instructors/designers only. Do not copy these directly into student-facing materials. Instead, extract the needed information and present it in the appropriate student material (slides, handouts, assignment descriptions in the Assignments directory, etc.).

Every change to the course plan should be reflected in this directory. For example, if you introduce a new topic or shift an assignment to a different week, update *Schedule.md* accordingly and ensure all related materials (Topics, Assignments) are adjusted for consistency. Keeping the Notes accurate and up-to-date is crucial for maintaining alignment between **objectives, content, and assessments** throughout the course.

# Workflow for Maintaining Course Notes

This workflow guides content creators through updating and utilizing the planning documents in the **Notes** directory. Follow these steps whenever the course plan changes or when you create new content, to ensure all high-level documents stay consistent and useful.

1. **Review the Current Plan:** Before making any changes, open **Schedule.md** and **Planning.md** to understand the existing course structure and pending tasks. Ensure you know the course’s learning outcomes and weekly objectives. (If the course has formal learning outcomes, keep those in mind as you work, even though they may not be explicitly listed here.)

2. **Update the Course Schedule (Schedule.md) as Needed:** If you add, remove, or reorder topics or assignments:
   - Open `Notes/Schedule.md` in a text editor.
   - Locate the week that needs changes. Maintain the same format (use bullet points under the correct week).
   - **Insert or modify entries** to reflect the new plan. For example, if Week 5 is now adding a “File I/O” topic, add a bullet like `- File I/O basics (reading/writing files)` under Week 5. Include any new assignment names or activities under the appropriate week.
   - Double-check consistency: The week’s topics in Schedule.md should match the content in the Topics directory and the assignments in the Assignments directory. For instance, if you added "File I/O basics" to Week 5 here, ensure a corresponding topic file (e.g. `Topics/file_i_o.md`) exists or is being created, and that an assignment on File I/O (if planned) is accounted for in Assignments.
   - **Save** the file and verify the Markdown formatting is correct (e.g. each week is a heading, sub-items are indented properly).

3. **Align Other Materials with Schedule Changes:** If Schedule.md was updated:
   - Go to the **Topics** directory and confirm that any topic files mentioned in the updated schedule exist and cover the intended material. If not, create a placeholder topic file (or note in Planning.md to create it).
   - Go to the **Assignments** directory and ensure any assignment referenced in the schedule (by name or number) is present. If you moved an assignment to a different week, its numbering might stay the same but check that the timing still makes sense (e.g. students have learned the required concepts by that week).
   - Check cross-references: if other planning documents or instructions mention the old sequence (for example, an assignment instruction saying “as you learned last week”), update those if the schedule shifted.

4. **Add or Update Planning Notes (Planning.md):** Use *Planning.md* to log any new tasks or mark completed tasks:
   - If you decided to create a new quiz, assignment, or topic, add a bullet under *Objectives* (or an appropriate section) describing that task. For example, “- create Week 5 File I/O lesson materials”.
   - If a task is finished, you may mark it as done (if using checkboxes in Markdown) or remove it if the list is purely for active tasks. For example, once the style guide is completed, you might update the line from “create a style guide” to “✅ style guide created (needs periodic updates)”.
   - Keep the list tidy: remove or refine tasks that are no longer relevant. For instance, if the plan to use a `NewInstructions` folder was changed in favor of keeping instructions in the Assignments directory, update or annotate that in the planning notes to avoid confusion.
   - **Save** changes to Planning.md.

5. **Leverage Legacy References (OldCourseContent.md & OldInstructions):** When developing a new piece of content (like a lesson or assignment), consult these references for inspiration or to avoid past pitfalls:
   - Open the relevant old instruction file if one exists (e.g., if creating a C# “Better Calculator” assignment, read `OldInstructions/05-BetterCalculator.md` to see what was expected in the VB version).
   - Extract useful details (like what the program should do) but **do not copy text verbatim** – rewrite it in C# context and in a fresh way for the new course.
   - If OldCourseContent.md has related links or resources (many are placeholders marked “(URL)”), find updated C# equivalents for those resources if you need to include similar references in new materials. (For example, if it mentions “Arithmetic Operators in Visual Basic (URL)”, you would find the C# documentation for arithmetic operators to use in your new topic file.)

6. **Avoid Modifying Legacy Files:** Do not edit files in *OldInstructions/* or the content of *OldCourseContent.md* except for minor annotation:
   - These are preserved for historical reference. Changing them might cause confusion about what was originally in the old course.
   - If you must note something (e.g., “see C# equivalent in ...”), add a clearly marked note or comment rather than removing the old info.
   - If you determine a legacy file is no longer needed at all (e.g., you’ve converted all its information and it’s not useful anymore), you can propose removing it from the repository. If you do, ensure nothing else is still referencing it.

7. **Maintain Alignment with Course Objectives:** Whenever you update these notes, think about backward design:
   - Ask yourself: “Does this change still ensure students will achieve the intended outcomes?” For example, if you’re adding a new assignment, does it test skills from recent topics (and are those topics adequately covered before the assignment)?
   - Make a habit of cross-checking *Schedule.md* against any formal course outcome list (if available). If the course outcome says “students will be able to use arrays,” ensure the schedule has a week on arrays (it does in Week 6, for example) and perhaps an assignment or exercise on arrays around that time.

8. **Double-Check Links and References:** If you add any links in these planning documents (to external resources or to files within the repo):
   - Verify that each link is correct. For local files, use relative paths and ensure the spelling and case match the actual file names (GitHub is case-sensitive in links).
   - For external URLs (like Microsoft Docs links in OldCourseContent), make sure they are current and accessible. Update the URL if the resource moved.
   - If you introduce a new document, update any “Additional Resources” or table of contents in the root README or elsewhere if needed.

9. **Save and Commit:** After making changes to any Notes files:
   - Save your edits and preview them in a Markdown viewer to confirm formatting.
   - Commit your changes with a clear message, e.g., “Update Week 5 schedule and add File I/O topic plan” or “Mark assignment 3 as completed in Planning.md”.
   - Push the commit so the team has the updated plan.

By following this workflow, you ensure the **Notes** remain a reliable single source of truth for the course structure. This helps all content creators stay on the same page and keeps the course materials aligned with the overall plan and learning goals.

# Topics (Lesson Content)

This directory contains the **lesson plan content and concept guides** for each topic in the course. It is organized by subject area (e.g. variables, loops, GUI programming) rather than by calendar week, although the numbering roughly follows the course progression. **Course developers** use these documents to prepare lectures, tutorials, or reading material for students. Each file here breaks down a key topic in introductory C# programming, with explanations, examples, and references.

## Contents and Structure

- **topics_overview.md** – A high-level outline of all major topics and subtopics covered in the course:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}. This serves as a “table of contents” for the Topics directory. Use it to get a quick overview of what should be covered and to navigate to specific topic files.
- **Individual Topic Files:** Each primary topic has its own Markdown file (e.g. `variables_constants.md`, `loops.md`, `object_oriented_programming_oop.md`). Inside each, you will typically find:
  - **Introduction:** A brief, beginner-friendly introduction explaining what the topic is and why it matters.
  - **Subtopics and Explanations:** The core content, often broken into sections (with second-level or third-level headings). For example, a **Loops** topic might have sections for `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops, including syntax, common mistakes, and use cases:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}.
  - **Code Examples:** Annotated C# code snippets demonstrating each concept. Every example should be complete and runnable where possible, to allow learners (or instructors in class) to try them out. Follow the coding style guide for all examples (consistency helps students focus on the concept, not the format:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}).
  - **Practical Exercises or Tips:** Many topics include a "Practical" or "Try it" section suggesting quick exercises, real-world connections, or common pitfalls. This is to encourage hands-on practice and to reinforce the material.
  - **References:** At the end, a list of relevant links for further reading, typically pointing to Microsoft's official C# documentation (and possibly sections of our style guide or other topics). The file `dotnet_documentation_links.md` in this directory provides a curated collection of such links for convenience:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}:contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}.
- **dotnet_documentation_links.md** – A compilation of official .NET/C# documentation links, organized by difficulty (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced). Instead of hard-coding lengthy URLs in every topic file, use this as a reference. You can link to specific entries or simply consult it to find appropriate documentation to cite in your topic. Keeping these links centralized also makes it easier to update if URLs change.
- **topic_update_workflow.md** – (If present) A guide for systematically updating topic files. This may outline best practices for writing clear explanations, adding examples, and linking resources. (We have incorporated those guidelines into our new workflow below, so this file may overlap with the new Topics workflow document.)

## How to Use the Topics Directory

- **Lesson Planning:** Use the topic files as the basis for lectures or learning modules. Each is written to be beginner-friendly, so they can double as reading material or instructor notes. Ensure that for each class session or week, the relevant topic files are up to date and cover the learning objectives planned for that period.
- **Consistency and Scaffolded Learning:** The order of files (roughly 1 through N as listed in *topics_overview.md*) is intentional – basic concepts (like program structure, data types) come first, and advanced ones (like GUI, graphics) come later:contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}:contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}. This scaffolded sequence helps beginners build on earlier knowledge. When adding or modifying content, maintain this logical progression. For example, don’t introduce an advanced concept like multi-threading in the early Variables topic – that’s reserved for “Not in This Course” or advanced sections.
- **Alignment with Assignments:** Check the Assignments directory to see what tasks students must perform, and ensure each topic gives them the necessary background. For instance, if there’s an assignment to read and write files in Week 12, the **File I/O** topic (`file_i_o.md`) must thoroughly prepare students for that (covering how to read from and write to files, error handling, etc.). Likewise, if a topic introduces a concept that isn’t directly assessed, consider adding a small practice exercise or ensuring a quiz question covers it, so nothing is left without reinforcement.
- **Beginner Perspective:** Always approach writing and updating these documents from the perspective of an absolute beginner. Avoid assuming prior knowledge beyond what has been covered in earlier topics. Define terms when they first appear (e.g., explain “IDE” or “namespace” on first use). The style guide’s beginner tips (e.g., prefer explicit, clear code over “clever” code:contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}) should be reflected in examples here.
- **Keep it Up-to-Date:** If C# or .NET introduces new relevant features (say a new way to do something that’s simpler), update the appropriate topic file to include it or at least mention it. Also, periodically click through the reference links in case Microsoft’s URLs or content have changed, updating them via `dotnet_documentation_links.md` as needed.

By maintaining the Topics directory carefully, you ensure that the course content is comprehensive and that each lesson flows logically into the next. These documents form the core instructional material which all other components (assignments, quizzes, etc.) should reference and reinforce, so accuracy and clarity here are paramount.

# Workflow for Creating or Updating Topic Files

This step-by-step workflow helps content creators develop clear, consistent, and pedagogically sound topic documents. **Follow every step in order – do not skip steps.** Assume nothing; be explicit and thorough to ensure each topic file stands on its own and aligns with the course objectives.

1. **Clarify the Topic and Objectives:** Identify the topic you will create or update, and determine what students should be able to do or understand after learning it. Refer to the course schedule to see where this topic falls in the sequence and what the course outcomes are. *For example:* If the topic is **Loops**, objectives might be “Students can construct `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops to repeat actions and understand loop control statements.” Write these outcomes down for reference (you may include them in the introduction or keep them in mind to guide content).

2. **Create or Open the Topic File:** 
   - If this is a **new topic**, create a new Markdown file in the `Topics` directory. Name it clearly and in lowercase with underscores (e.g., `basic_operators.md` for “Basic Operators”). If a similar file exists (maybe from a draft or differently named), decide whether to rename it or start fresh. Also update `topics_overview.md` to include this new topic in the outline (if it’s not already listed).
   - If you are **updating an existing topic**, open the corresponding `.md` file. Read it fully first to understand its current structure and content.

3. **Start with a Strong Introduction:** At the top of the file:
   - Write a level-1 heading (`# Topic Name`) if not already present.
   - Below that, add a short **Introduction** section (you can use a level-2 heading like `## Introduction` for clarity). In 2-3 sentences, explain what this topic is about and **why it matters** to a beginner programmer:contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}. Use simple language, and assume the reader has no prior exposure to this concept. For example: “Loops allow a program to repeat actions without writing the same code multiple times. They’re useful for tasks like processing lists of data or running until a condition is met.”
   - If appropriate, state the learning objectives briefly (either in the intro text or as a bullet list titled “Objectives:” right after the intro). E.g., “By the end of this section, you should be able to write `for` and `while` loops to repeat actions, and decide which loop type fits a given problem.”

4. **Outline the Subtopics:** Before diving into writing, list out the key sub-sections you need to cover (either mentally or as placeholder subheadings in the document):
   - Use the course outline (*topics_overview.md*) as a guide to ensure you cover all subpoints. For instance, for a **Loops** topic, your sub-sections might be `For Loops`, `While Loops`, `Do-While Loops`, and `Loop Control (break/continue)`.
   - Create a logical order: typically introduce simpler concepts first (e.g., `for` loop syntax) before complex ones (nested loops or special cases).
   - Add second-level headings (##) for each subtopic in the file, if not already present. This will make the document easier to navigate and update.

5. **Draft Each Subsection with Clarity:**
   - For each subtopic, write explanatory text as if addressing a beginner. **Define terms** when introduced (e.g., “An *array* is a collection of elements of the same type…”). Keep sentences short and straightforward.
   - Include **examples and analogies**. For instance, when explaining a loop, you might say “A `for` loop acts like a repetitive task list: it runs the same code for a set number of times or until a condition is met.”
   - Break down complex ideas. If a concept has multiple parts (like the three components of a for-loop: initialization, condition, increment), bullet them or number them for clarity.
   - Keep paragraphs short (3-5 sentences max). Use bullet points or tables for listing information (e.g., a table comparing loop types or a list of common mistakes).
   - **Use beginner-friendly tone:** Avoid unnecessary jargon. If you must use a term (like “iteration” or “variable scope”), explain it in context.
   - Cross-reference other topics if helpful: e.g., “Recall from the **Variables** section that a loop counter must be declared with a type.” If you mention something covered elsewhere, consider adding a parenthetical `(see *variables_constants.md*)` or a hyperlink for reference.

6. **Insert Code Examples Frequently:**
   - After explaining a concept, show it in code. Use fenced code blocks with language hint ` ```csharp ` for syntax highlighting.
   - **Provide complete, runnable examples** whenever possible, rather than snippets missing context. For example, include a `Main` method or a short program demonstrating a loop, so a reader could copy-paste and run it.
   - Make examples simple and focused: if teaching loops, use a trivial computation or print-out (e.g., printing numbers 1-5) so the logic of the loop is front and center. Do not introduce unrelated complex logic.
   - **Follow the style guide in all examples:** e.g., curly braces on their own lines, 4 spaces indentation, meaningful variable names:contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}:contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}. This consistency reinforces good habits (the style guide rules such as always using braces even for one-line loops should be evident in your examples).
   - Test each example code by actually running it (either in an IDE or using `dotnet run` for a quick console app). Verify it produces the expected output and has no errors. This ensures accuracy and that the code is ready for students to try.

7. **Enhance with Official References:**
   - Identify any key classes, methods, or concepts that have relevant official documentation. For example, if this topic is **File I/O**, you’d want to link to Microsoft’s documentation on `System.IO.File` methods.
   - Use the `dotnet_documentation_links.md` file to find appropriate links. For instance, for a topic on **Exceptions**, use the link provided for “try-catch” or error handling.
   - Within the text, when a reference would be useful, do something like: “C# provides a `Math` class with many useful mathematical functions (see Microsoft’s **Math Class** docs for details).” Then list the full link in the **References** section at the end of the file.
   - If `dotnet_documentation_links.md` does not have what you need, you may add a new link there (keeping the format consistent) and then reference it. For example, if adding a link for “Switch statements documentation,” update that file under the appropriate section (Beginner, likely) and then cite it.

8. **Add a Practical Component:**
   - After covering the informational content, include a section (it could be a heading like `## Practical Example` or `## Exercise` or a **Practical:** bold note) to encourage hands-on engagement:contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}:contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}.
   - This might be a short exercise or challenge. For instance: “**Practice:** Write a loop that prints all even numbers from 10 down to 2. Try it on your own before checking the provided example.” You can even provide an answer in a collapsible section or separate example file if that’s part of the design.
   - These practical prompts help ensure alignment with assessments – they serve as self-checks so students can gauge if they learned what they were supposed to. Design them to mirror, in simpler form, what an assignment or exam question might require.

9. **Finalize the References Section:**
   - Create a `## References` section at the end of the topic file (if not already there).
   - List any external documentation links or relevant cross-references used in the content. Use bullet points with meaningful link text. For example:
     - `[C# for Beginners: Loops](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/intro-to-csharp/loops)` – if there’s a specific MS tutorial on loops.
     - If you referred to sections of the style guide or other internal docs, you can include those too (e.g., a reference to “See our [Style Guide on Naming](../StyleGuide/03-NamingConventions.md)” if naming was a big part of the topic).
   - Ensure each link is working: click them to verify they go to the intended page. (If a Microsoft link redirects or is broken, find the updated one on docs.microsoft.com.)
   - If you added new entries in `dotnet_documentation_links.md` for this topic, commit that file alongside to keep references consistent.

10. **Self-Review for Clarity and Completeness:**
    - **Read through the entire topic file from the perspective of a student with no background except prior topics.** Does it flow logically? Did you inadvertently assume knowledge that wasn’t introduced? If something might be unfamiliar, add an explanation.
    - Check that all important subtopics planned are indeed covered. Compare against the original outline or topics overview list to be sure nothing was skipped.
    - Ensure consistency in terminology and notation. For example, if you bolded key terms in one section, do so for key terms throughout. If one topic file uses American spelling and another British (color vs colour), standardize that (prefer American English for coding context, unless instructed otherwise).
    - Verify that **every example compiles and runs** as written. If you made any last edits to code in the writing process, run it again to catch typos or errors.
    - Run a spell check and grammar check on your text. Miscommunications can arise from simple errors.
    - Make sure the tone remains encouraging and not overwhelming. We want students to feel confident, not intimidated.

11. **Double-Check Links and Formatting:**
    - Scroll through the file and click each hyperlink (both internal and external) to ensure none are broken and all point to the correct resource.
    - Check that all Markdown formatting (headings, bullets, code fences) is correct. A missing backtick or a stray asterisk can break formatting for a large section, so it's worth the quick scan in preview mode.
    - If the topic file is lengthy, consider adding a brief table of contents at the top (especially if it covers many subheadings). GitHub will often auto-generate a TOC on the side, but for published materials, a list of section links at the top can help navigation.
    - Confirm that images (if any) or diagrams are properly embedded and have captions or descriptions. (In many cases, topics may not have images; but if you need one, ensure it’s stored in the repo and referenced correctly.)

12. **Commit with Clear Message:** Save your changes and commit the updated/new topic file:
    - Write a commit message that includes the topic name and whether it’s a new addition or a revision. For example: “Add new topic: File I/O with examples and references” or “Update Loops topic for clarity and added do-while example.”
    - If multiple files were changed (e.g., you also updated the topics overview or documentation links), include those in the same commit or a logically grouped set of commits.

By meticulously following this workflow, you will produce topic documents that are **educator-friendly and student-friendly** – they’ll be accurate, easy to understand, and aligned with the rest of the course. Remember: *thoroughness and clarity at this stage prevent confusion and mislearning later.* Always double-check that you have completed every step above before considering a topic file “done.”

# Assignments (Projects and Exercises)

This directory contains all the programming assignments for the course, including their descriptions and any starter or example code. It is organized by assignment number. Each assignment reinforces concepts taught in the lectures/topics and gives students hands-on practice.

## Structure

- **00-AssignmentInstructions/** – This folder holds the *master copy* of each assignment's instructions in Markdown format. Each file is named with the assignment number and title (e.g., `05-BetterCalculator.md`). These are the **student-facing instructions** that describe what to build and any specific requirements. Keeping them all together makes it easy to review all assignments and maintain consistency in formatting and phrasing.
- **Individual Assignment Folders (01-**, **02-**, **03-**, etc.):** Each assignment has its own subdirectory named with a two-digit number and a short title. For example:
  - `02-SayMyName/` – Contains the project for the "Say My Name" assignment. Inside, you typically find a Visual Studio solution (`SayMyName.sln`), a project folder with `.cs` source files (like `Program.cs`), and possibly an instruction file (e.g., `SayMyNameInstructions.md`). *(Note: In some existing assignments, an instructions file is present here, but going forward, we keep the authoritative instructions in the central 00-AssignmentInstructions folder to avoid duplication.)*
  - `03-SimpleCalculator/` – Project for "Simple Calculator" assignment (Console application).
  - `04-SayMyNameAgain/` – Project for "Say My Name... Again" assignment, etc.
  - ...and so on through the final project (e.g., `18-StansGrocery/` for the capstone assignment).
- Each assignment folder contains all the code necessary to run a **sample solution or template** for that assignment:
  - A `.sln` file (solution file) and one or more `.csproj` project files.
  - Program code files. For early console assignments, usually just `Program.cs`. For later GUI assignments, there may be multiple files (Form classes, etc.) plus designer files.
  - Any additional resources needed for the assignment to run (for example, data files like `Grocery.txt` for Stan's Grocery, images for GUI, etc.).
  - In some cases, a Markdown file with instructions may be present in the folder, but **those are duplicates** of the ones in 00-AssignmentInstructions. The presence of such duplicates is legacy – moving forward, edit instructions in one place (the central folder) to maintain one source of truth:contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}.

## Purpose and Use

- **Reinforcement of Topics:** Each assignment is aligned with the topics covered up to that point in the course. For example, after students learn about strings and user input, there’s an assignment like “Say My Name” to practice those; after learning about loops, assignments like “Multiplication Table” appear. The assignments increase in complexity as the course progresses:
  - Early assignments (01–05) are simple console applications focusing on basics (printing output, using variables, basic arithmetic, conditional logic):contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}.
  - Mid-range assignments (06–12) incorporate loops, functions, and perhaps simple data structures or more complex logic:contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}:contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}.
  - Later assignments (13–18) introduce GUI programming (Windows Forms), file I/O, and larger project structure, culminating in a comprehensive final project (Stan’s Grocery) that ties together GUI, data handling, and user interaction:contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}:contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25}.
- **For Content Creators:** This directory is where you will add new assignments or update existing ones. When designing assignments, ensure they directly reflect and require mastery of the skills taught in recent Topics. For example, if students just learned about arrays and lists in Week 6, the assignment due that week should involve arrays or lists in a practical way.
- **Instructions vs. Implementation:** The Markdown files in 00-AssignmentInstructions are what you will give to students (e.g., via the LMS or printed in a handout). They describe *what* the student must do. The code in each assignment folder can serve as:
  - A **solution reference or unit tests** (if you are an instructor wanting to test student submissions).
  - A **starter template** in cases where some code is pre-provided (though in our current setup, most assignments expect students to start from scratch, some might come with partial code or a project with an empty form for GUI assignments).
  - Ensure that any code you include here (especially for GUI assignments) follows the style guide and is something you’re okay with students eventually seeing (they might not see our solution, but sometimes we might share parts as hints or if they really struggle after due date).
- **Naming Conventions and Organization:** We follow the style guide for naming. Assignment folders and files use PascalCase and a brief description:contentReference[oaicite:26]{index=26}. The number prefix (e.g., "05-") is used to keep assignments in order. *Do not change these numbers lightly* – if you need to reorder assignments, discuss and update references everywhere (schedule, any mentions in topics, etc.). The style guide explicitly advises using plural, PascalCase names for directories like “Assignments”:contentReference[oaicite:27]{index=27} – note that currently the top-level directory is spelled “Assingments” (with an extra 's'), which is a typo to be addressed for consistency.

## Alignment with Course Goals

Assignments are a key component of backward design: each one is meant to assess and practice specific learning objectives from the course:
- Before finalizing an assignment, double-check which topic(s) it maps to and ensure those topics have been covered in the Topics materials. For example, the **Better Calculator (05)** assignment assumes knowledge of arithmetic operations and input handling (from Week 2 or 3 topics):contentReference[oaicite:28]{index=28}.
- Conversely, ensure that for every major topic covered in class, there is either an assignment or a quiz/exercise addressing it. If a topic has no assignment, it might have a quiz instead – verify this against the course plan so nothing important is left unassessed.
- The difficulty and length of assignments should ramp up gradually (scaffolded skill development). Early assignments might be very short (a few lines of code), whereas later ones (like the final project) are multi-step and more open-ended. When adding new assignments or adjusting them, maintain this progression.

By organizing the Assignments directory in this way and following these guidelines, content creators can systematically develop projects that are consistent, fair, and directly tied to what students learn in the classroom. Always keep communication open with other instructors/developers to ensure the assignments fit well together and cover the breadth of the course’s objectives.

# Workflow for Developing and Updating Assignments

This workflow ensures each programming assignment is created and updated systematically, with clear instructions and proper alignment to course content. **Follow these steps exactly** when adding a new assignment or modifying an existing one:

1. **Identify the Assignment’s Role:** Determine where in the course the assignment will be given (which week) and what learning outcomes it targets. Check the course schedule (Notes/Schedule.md) to see the context. For example, if designing an assignment for Week 7, note the topics of Week 1–7 (e.g. arrays, loops, etc.) so the assignment can incorporate those. Every assignment should reinforce recent topics and skills the students have learned or are currently learning.

2. **Choose an Assignment Number and Title:** If it’s a new assignment, find the next available number or the appropriate number in sequence:
   - Use two-digit numbering (e.g., “07” for assignment 7). If reordering or inserting, adjust accordingly, but try to avoid decimals or letters; stick to the numeric sequence used in the repo.
   - Pick a concise, descriptive title that reflects the task (e.g., “FortuneCookie” for a random fortune generator, “BetterCalculator” for an improved calculator). **Use PascalCase** and no spaces in the folder/file names:contentReference[oaicite:29]{index=29}.
   - Example: If the next assignment after 05-BetterCalculator is about loops, you might name it `06-MultiplicationTable` (if it's about printing a multiplication table).
   - Create a new folder under `Assignments` with the exact name format `XX-Title` (where XX is the number). For instance, create `Assignments/06-MultiplicationTable/`.
   - *Double-check spelling and case*: the directory name will propagate to project names. Following the style guide on naming is critical here (the style guide expects “Assignments” spelled correctly; fix the top-level name if you have access, to maintain consistency:contentReference[oaicite:30]{index=30}).

3. **Set Up the Project in the New Folder:** 
   - Open your IDE (e.g., Visual Studio) or use the .NET CLI to create a project:
     - For console assignments, you can run `dotnet new console -o 06-MultiplicationTable` inside the `Assignments` directory. This will create a new console project in that folder.
     - For GUI assignments (Windows Forms), create a new Windows Forms App project in that folder. In Visual Studio, you might need to create the project then move it into the desired folder or specify the location on creation.
   - Name the project and solution appropriately. Ideally, use the same name as the folder after the number. For example, solution name “MultiplicationTable” and project name “MultiplicationTable”. Visual Studio might create a sln and a project file; ensure they reside in the assignment’s folder (e.g., `06-MultiplicationTable.sln` and `06-MultiplicationTable/MultiplicationTable.csproj`).
   - Verify that the namespace in Program.cs (and other files) matches the project name (it often does by default). For instance, it might be `namespace MultiplicationTable`.
   - **Add any starter code** if needed: Most assignments start from scratch, but if you intend to provide a skeleton (like a WinForms UI with some controls pre-placed), set that up now. Otherwise, a default Program.cs that prints “Hello World” (from the template) is fine as a starting point.

4. **Create or Update the Instruction Markdown:**
   - In the `00-AssignmentInstructions` folder, create a new Markdown file named `XX-Title.md` matching the assignment number and title. (For updates, open the existing file.)
   - Begin the file with a top-level heading: `# Assignment Title` (e.g., “# Multiplication Table”).
   - Write the **Project Setup** section. Most assignment instruction files start with a note referring students to generic setup instructions:
     - e.g., `## Project Setup` then a sentence like “See [Project Setup Instructions](./ProjectSetup.md) for detailed steps on how to set up your C# project and version control for this assignment.” Use the same phrasing as other assignments for consistency:contentReference[oaicite:31]{index=31}. If `ProjectSetup.md` doesn’t exist yet, you can still include the reference (and then create that file separately or instruct students in class about project creation).
   - Write the **Assignment Instructions** section:
     - Use clear, enumerated or bulleted requirements. For example:
       1. “Create a program that prints a 10x10 multiplication table of integers.”
       2. “The first row and first column should contain the numbers 1 through 10 as headers.”
       3. “Each cell should be the product of its row and column header.”
       4. “Format the table with aligned columns (hint: use tab or spacing).”
     - Be extremely explicit about what is required:
       - If input from the user is needed, specify: “Ask the user to enter X…”.
       - If specific output format is expected, show an example output snippet or describe it exactly (e.g., “The output should exactly match the pattern shown:…”).
       - If naming is important (for GUI controls, filenames, classes), list the names. For example: “Name the form `MainForm` and include a label called `ResultLabel`.” In our assignments, you’ll see sections like **Controls and Naming** specifying this:contentReference[oaicite:32]{index=32}. Provide such details especially for GUI assignments to ensure uniformity.
     - Include any **Additional Requirements** or constraints:
       - Performance constraints (if any, though unlikely in intro course).
       - Edge cases to handle (e.g., “If the user enters a negative number, the program should display an error message instead of a table.”).
       - Good practices (e.g., “Use at least one loop; do not hard-code all outputs with 100 `Console.WriteLine` statements.”).
       - For GUI assignments: behaviors like “The form’s close button should actually exit the application” or “Pressing Enter in the text box should trigger the calculate event” if relevant.
     - Ensure the tone is instructive but not solving the problem for them. Tell them *what* to do, not exactly *how* to code it (unless teaching a specific method is intended).
   - If this assignment builds on a previous one or relates to it, mention that. E.g., “This assignment is an extension of Assignment 03 - Simple Calculator; you will reuse some logic from it.”
   - **Review other instruction files** in 00-AssignmentInstructions to mirror the style and structure. All assignments should have a similar format:
     - Title, Project Setup blurb, a horizontal rule (`---`), then Assignment Instructions as a list, maybe sub-sections like “Controls and Naming” or “Additional Requirements”, and possibly a closing note about submission.
     - Consistency helps students quickly grasp the requirements without searching.

5. **Develop the Assignment Solution (for verification):**
   - Write the code for the assignment in the new project folder to ensure the instructions are feasible and unambiguous.
   - This solution can serve as the instructor’s reference or to generate expected outputs. It might not be shared with students (until after grading), but building it ensures you haven’t asked for something impossible or unclear.
   - As you implement, pay attention to any assumptions you made in the instructions. For example, if you find that the instructions didn’t specify how to handle a certain input, update the instructions to include that.
   - Keep the solution code **clean and style-compliant** (use our Style Guide: naming, spacing, comments if needed:contentReference[oaicite:33]{index=33}). This solution might later be used as an example or for automated tests.
   - Test the solution thoroughly: try normal cases, edge cases, and incorrect inputs if applicable. Confirm that the program behaves as the instructions intend. This way, you can catch if the instructions forgot to mention something (like “what if input is zero?”) and then fix the instructions.
   - Do **not** commit the solution with debugging artifacts or personal info. If you added any temporary test code, remove it or comment it out in the final version.

6. **Integrate any Provided Resources:**
   - If the assignment needs a data file (like the grocery list for Stan’s Grocery) or images (for a GUI), add them to the assignment folder now. For example, place `Grocery.txt` inside `18-StansGrocery/` and ensure your solution code expects it in the correct relative location.
   - Update the instructions to tell students about these resources: e.g., “A file named `Grocery.txt` is provided with this assignment – your program should load data from it. (Ensure `Grocery.txt` is placed in the same directory as your executable or set its Copy property to Output Directory in Visual Studio.)”
   - Double-check that any file paths in code are handled correctly (perhaps using relative paths or instructing the student accordingly).
   - If using Windows Forms, ensure the forms and controls are properly named as per instructions (because you likely designed them while coding the solution). It’s easy for an instructor solution to have the correct names, but double-check that those exact names are spelled out in the instructions under a “Controls” section so students do the same:contentReference[oaicite:34]{index=34}.

7. **Update Course Documents for the New Assignment:**
   - Open `Notes/Schedule.md` and add the new assignment under the correct week, if it’s not already listed. Follow the existing format: e.g., “W7 - Multiplication Table Assignment” under Week 7.
   - Check if any Topic documents should reference the assignment. Usually not directly, but a topic might say “you will practice this in the upcoming assignment.” If it makes sense, you can add a sentence in a topic file like “(This concept will appear in the Assignment 06: Multiplication Table.)” – not mandatory, but it can help tie things together.
   - If the Planning.md has a to-do like “create assignment for loops”, mark it done or update it with the assignment name.
   - Also consider quizzes or other assessments: ensure the introduction of this assignment doesn’t conflict with a planned quiz or vice versa (e.g., if Week 7 had a quiz on loops, having the assignment also on loops is fine – just ensure both are coordinated in difficulty).

8. **Double-Check Instruction Clarity and Consistency:**
   - Read through the assignment instruction Markdown as if you are a student seeing it fresh. Is every requirement unambiguous? Are the sentences clear and free of instructor-only language? (For example, avoid saying “As we discussed in class…” in the written instructions; assume a student might rely solely on this text.)
   - Check for consistency in phrasing with other assignments. For instance, if other assignments end with “Remember to include the standard program header comment in your code.”, include that here as well if needed:contentReference[oaicite:35]{index=35}. Consistent reminders (like coding style, comment header) should appear in each assignment’s text.
   - Ensure formatting is neat: use lists for requirements, **bold** or *italic* to highlight keywords if needed (but don’t overdo it), and triple backticks for any inline code or code blocks within instructions.
   - Verify that the assignment title/number in the instruction file matches what you put in the schedule and folder name. Mismatches in numbering or naming will confuse students (e.g., instructions say “Assignment 7” but schedule says 6). Fix any inconsistencies now.
   - If you included example input/output in the instructions, make sure it exactly matches what the solution does. If the solution prints “Enter a number: ” but the instructions example doesn’t show that prompt, update one of them to match the other.

9. **Eliminate Redundancy and Update Sources of Truth:**
   - If you created an instructions file in the assignment’s own folder (some earlier assignments did, like `SayMyNameInstructions.md` inside `02-SayMyName/`), decide on the single source of truth. The recommended approach is to keep the Markdown in 00-AssignmentInstructions only, to avoid maintaining two copies.
   - If a duplicate exists, remove it or add a note in its header saying “(Deprecated, see ../00-AssignmentInstructions/XX-Name.md for latest instructions)” and plan to remove it eventually. This prevents confusion. For new assignments, **do not** create a second instructions file in the project folder – just rely on the central one.
   - Check `Notes/OldInstructions/` to see if an old VB version exists. You don’t need to delete it (it’s historical), but you might note in Planning.md that “Assignment 06 converted to C# – old VB instruction available in OldInstructions/06-… for reference.” And per the conversion guide, remove any placeholders or incorrect names related to it if they were brought over during the process:contentReference[oaicite:36]{index=36}.
   - If the *ProjectSetup.md* is not yet written (and you’ve been referencing it), consider creating that file in 00-AssignmentInstructions as a generic guide for students (e.g., how to create a new project, how to use Git for assignments). At minimum, remind yourself or the team that this is a pending task (so our references to it aren’t broken by the time students need it).

10. **Double-Check All Links and Names:**
    - In the instruction file, click any link (if you referenced ProjectSetup or a style guide section) to ensure they resolve. A relative link `./ProjectSetup.md` will work once that file exists in the same folder – if it doesn’t yet, that’s okay but know you need to supply that content soon.
    - If you mention the style guide or any external resource in the instructions, ensure it’s properly cited or the name is correct. For instance, if telling students “follow the coding conventions,” you might link to the style guide summary or just assume they know from class – decide consistently.
    - Verify that control names and file names in the instructions exactly match those in the solution code you wrote (if you wrote one). Even a slight mismatch (e.g., `ResultLabel` vs `ResultsLabel`) can confuse students and cause grading scripts to fail if used. Update either the code or the text so they align.
    - Look at the assignment folder and ensure no unintended files are included (sometimes IDEs generate obj/ or bin/ directories – those should be in .gitignore and not committed). Only commit the source, project files, and any necessary resources. No compiled binaries or user-specific files.

11. **Commit the Assignment Files:**
    - Add and commit **everything** related to this assignment in one commit (or a series of commits with logical grouping). This includes:
      - The new assignment project folder (all `.cs` files, `.sln`, `.csproj`, etc., plus any resource files).
      - The Markdown instructions in 00-AssignmentInstructions.
      - Updates to Schedule.md, Planning.md, topics, or other docs that reference this assignment.
      - If applicable, the new ProjectSetup.md (if you wrote it now).
    - Write a clear commit message like: “Add Assignment 06 - Multiplication Table (instructions and solution)” or “Update Assignment 07 instructions and project”.
    - Push the commit to the repository so others can see and review.

12. **Communicate with the Team (if applicable):** Let your fellow instructors or content developers know about the new assignment. Share any important notes, such as “Assignment 06 added – covers loops; please ensure Week 6 topics emphasize nested loops as that’s required” or “I’ve referenced ProjectSetup.md which we need to finalize for students.”
    - This step ensures everyone is aware of changes and can adjust their content (like quizzes or lectures) accordingly.
    - Also, schedule time to peer-review each other’s assignments if possible, to catch any unclear phrasing or unrealistic expectations before students see them.

Following this workflow will produce well-structured assignments that integrate smoothly with the rest of the course. By explicitly writing down requirements, testing them with actual code, and keeping everything consistent (naming, style, alignment with topics), you minimize confusion for students and instructors alike. Remember: an assignment should challenge students’ understanding, not their ability to decipher instructions. When in doubt, **clarify and simplify the wording** – without giving away the solution logic – and verify everything against the course objectives and style standards.

# Examples (Sample Code Snippets and Demonstrations)

The Examples directory contains small, focused C# programs that illustrate individual concepts or techniques. These are **teaching aids and reference examples** for instructors and content creators to use during lectures, in documentation, or for students to explore as supplementary material. Unlike assignments (which students must solve) or topics (which explain concepts), examples are meant to **show** how to implement something in code.

## Contents

- **(Planned Example Subfolders):** Each example will reside in its own subfolder within `Examples/`, named after the concept it demonstrates. For instance, an example that shows how to parse user input might live in `Examples/ParseInputExample/`, containing a simple Program.cs that reads a string and converts it to a number. Right now, this directory is a placeholder and may have only a README. As the course content is developed, new example projects should be added here whenever a standalone demo program would be useful.
- **README.md (this file):** Provides an overview of how examples are used and instructions for content creators on adding new examples.

## Purpose

- **Illustrating Concepts:** Examples are typically short programs (often console applications, but possibly mini GUI apps for demonstrating UI components) that focus on one concept or a small set of related concepts. They are used to **complement the Topics**. For example, if a topic file describes how a `for` loop works, an example program here might actually implement a `for` loop printing a pattern or summing numbers, which an instructor can run live or which a student can experiment with.
- **In-Class Demonstrations:** Instructors can open these example projects during class to live-demo behavior (e.g., show how a loop executes, how an exception is thrown, etc.). Having pre-written, tested examples saves class time and ensures demonstrations go smoothly.
- **Sandbox for Experimentation:** Students (or instructors) can run and modify these example programs to deepen understanding. Because they are separate from assignments, students can tinker with them without fear of “doing it wrong” on a graded exercise.
- **Reference for Common Patterns:** Some examples might show common programming patterns or usage of library classes (like reading a file, sorting a list, using DateTime, etc.) which students can later refer to when working on assignments or projects.

## Best Practices for Examples

- **One Concept per Example:** To keep things clear, each example should be narrowly focused. For instance, a `ArrayIterationExample` would strictly show how to iterate over an array in various ways. If multiple concepts need demonstration, use multiple example programs. This makes it easier for learners to isolate and study a single feature.
- **Keep Examples Simple:** Use the minimum amount of code to demonstrate the concept. Avoid including unrelated functionality. If an example is about string formatting, it doesn’t need file I/O or complex user input handling – maybe it hardcodes a few values or uses simple Console.ReadLine for input. The goal is that someone reading the code or seeing it run immediately grasps the relevant concept.
- **Follow the Style Guide:** All example code should be written with the same conventions we expect from students:contentReference[oaicite:37]{index=37}:contentReference[oaicite:38]{index=38}. This means proper indentation, braces on new lines, good naming, comments explaining non-obvious lines, etc. Examples serve as a model of good coding practice as well as illustrating the concept. If there’s a style point to be made (like how to name constants or where to put braces), the examples should consistently reflect that.
- **Document the Example (if needed):** Usually the code speaks for itself for simple examples. But if it’s not obvious, add a comment at the top of the `Program.cs` briefly stating what it demonstrates. For instance:

```csharp
// Example: Demonstrating a simple for-loop that computes the factorial of a number.
```
If the example is complex or you think other instructors might need guidance on using it, consider adding a README in that example’s folder or at least a note in this main README under a listing of examples.

* **Consistency with Course Content:** Ensure that examples don’t introduce topics that haven’t been covered yet (unless they are explicitly marked as advanced extras). For example, if lambdas are not taught in this intro course, an example should not suddenly use a lambda expression even if it’s a shortcut – that would confuse beginners. Stick to the approaches taught in class or documented in the Topics.
* **No Assessment in Examples:** These are not graded; they are purely instructional. So they don’t need to have tasks or questions for students (that’s for assignments and quizzes). If you find yourself wanting to turn an example into an exercise for students, that might belong in a topic file as a practice problem or in an assignment. Keep examples executable and complete rather than asking the reader to finish them (with the possible exception of leaving a minor tweak for in-class demonstration, which the instructor can do interactively).

## Using and Adding Examples

If you are teaching a concept and feel a runnable example would help:

* First, check if an example already exists in this directory or if a similar one exists in assignments (sometimes an assignment can double as an example, but usually assignments are more involved).
* If not, create one following the workflow below. Name it clearly, and once it’s added, consider mentioning it in the corresponding topic file. For example, after explaining a concept in a topic, you might add: “(See `Examples/ArrayIterationExample` in the repository for a complete program demonstrating this.)” – this helps other instructors and even diligent students to find it.
* Use the examples during preparation or live sessions to ensure they actually help illustrate the point. Adjust as needed based on student feedback (e.g., if they found an example too confusing or too trivial, refine it).

By maintaining a library of examples, over time the course gains a rich set of demonstrations that can be reused and improved. This ultimately saves preparation time and enhances learning, as students can see concepts in action and have a go-to source of correct, working code for common tasks.

# Workflow for Adding New Examples

Follow these steps to create a new example in the Examples directory or update an existing one. This process ensures examples are straightforward, useful, and consistent with our course standards. Assume the person following this has basic familiarity with creating projects but needs explicit guidance for consistency.

1. **Decide on the Concept to Demonstrate:** Identify exactly what concept or technique the example will cover. It should be something covered in the course material (or a small combination, like “using a loop with an if-condition inside”). For instance, “Demonstrate a basic `for` loop” or “Show how to read a text file line by line.” Be clear about the goal, as this will guide what code you write and keep the example focused.

2. **Check for Existing Examples:** Look into the `Examples/` directory (and also relevant Topic files or Assignments) to ensure you’re not duplicating something:
   - If a similar example exists but maybe in an assignment or buried in a topic document, you might still proceed to create a standalone example for clarity and easy access.
   - If an example exists but is outdated or not exactly what you need, plan to update or expand it.
   - If nothing relevant exists, proceed to the next step.

3. **Create a New Example Folder:** Inside the `Examples` directory, make a new subfolder with a descriptive name:
   - Use PascalCase and succinct words, with “Example” if it adds clarity. E.g., `ForLoopExample`, `FileReadExample`, `ListSortingExample`. Avoid spaces or special characters (stick to letters and maybe an underscore if absolutely needed, but PascalCase is preferred):contentReference[oaicite:39]{index=39}.
   - The folder name will also become the default project name (which is fine).
   - Ensure the name clearly reflects the content, as this is what instructors and students will see.

4. **Initialize a New .NET Project:**
   - Open a terminal in the `Examples` directory (or use an IDE interface) and run the appropriate command to create a console project. For most examples, **Console Application** is ideal because it’s simple and has no extra UI overhead. Use .NET CLI:
     ```
     dotnet new console -o YourExampleFolderName
     ```
     Replace `YourExampleFolderName` with the exact folder name you created (like `ForLoopExample`). This will create a new console project in that folder with a Program.cs.
   - Alternatively, in Visual Studio: create a new Console App project and specify the location as the new folder you made.
   - Remove any boilerplate code that isn’t needed (the template usually prints “Hello World”). You can start from that or clear it out to write your own.
   - Check that the project file (.csproj) and Program.cs are correctly placed in the folder. The CLI should handle this. The namespace in Program.cs might be the folder name; that’s okay.

5. **Write the Example Code in Program.cs:**
   - Write a comment at the top explaining the purpose of the program. For example:
     ```csharp
     // Example: Demonstrates the use of a basic for loop to calculate a factorial.
     ```
     This is for any instructor or student who opens the file to immediately know what it’s about.
   - Implement the code focusing only on the concept:
     - Keep it short. Usually 20 lines of relevant code (excluding boilerplate using statements and namespace) is plenty, though it can be more if needed for clarity (e.g., separating logic into a couple of small methods for demonstration).
     - Use clear, verbose output if it helps illustrate what’s happening. For instance, “Console.WriteLine("Loop iteration i=" + i);” in a loop example to show values each iteration.
     - **Follow the style guide** in everything: indentation 4 spaces (no tabs), proper braces placement, meaningful variable names, etc. Even if it’s a trivial example, treat it like production code style-wise. For example, do:
       ```csharp
       for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++)
       {
           Console.WriteLine($"i is {i}");
       }
       ```
       rather than a compressed one-liner loop, because we want readability and adherence to style (brace on its own line).
     - If demonstrating something that could be done in a clever way or a one-liner, prefer the expanded form first (since this is for beginners). You can always mention in a comment “// (Advanced: could also do this in one line, but for clarity we show the expanded form).”
     - Include error handling or edge cases only if it’s part of what you’re demonstrating. Otherwise, keep the code straightforward. For example, if the concept is file reading, you might show a try-catch around File.ReadAllText to demonstrate exception handling – but if the concept is just a loop, you don’t need to complicate it with try-catch (unless specifically teaching that synergy).
   - Run the program to ensure it works as expected. Use `dotnet run` inside the example folder or press F5 in Visual Studio. Verify the output and behavior align with the concept. If something unexpected happens (like needing to press Enter due to how console works), that’s fine – as an example, the user can handle it.

6. **Document Usage or Output (Optional but Helpful):**
   - Sometimes providing expected output can be educational. You could include a commented example of what the output looks like. E.g.:
     ```csharp
     // Expected Output:
     // i is 1
     // i is 2
     // i is 3
     // i is 4
     // i is 5
     ```
     This way, an instructor knows what to anticipate when running it, and a student can verify they got the same result.
   - Don’t over-comment the obvious, but do comment any lines that might not be clear to a beginner. For instance, “// Using string interpolation to print the value of i” if that hasn’t been covered extensively yet, but you choose to use it.
   - If the example requires some setup (maybe an input file for demonstration), note that in comments or provide the file. Prefer examples that don’t need external files to keep them self-contained, unless the whole point is demonstrating file I/O (in which case, include a small sample file and adjust your example code to find it in the same directory).

7. **Add an Entry in Examples/README.md (if using a listing):**
   - If the README (this file) is maintaining a list or table of available examples and their purpose, update it:
     - e.g., add a bullet: **ForLoopExample** – shows basic loop structure and output for each iteration.
     - Keep the format consistent with other entries. If none exist yet, you can start a “List of Examples” section.
   - Noting it in the README helps others quickly see what examples are available without scanning all folders.

8. **Cross-Reference the Example in Course Content (if relevant):**
   - Think about where this example will be most useful. If it aligns with a particular topic or assignment, consider adding a reference there:
     - In a Topic markdown (within the Topics directory), you might add a line: “(See **ForLoopExample** in the Examples folder for a complete program demonstrating a simple for-loop in action.)”
     - Make sure to format that as a hyperlink if the context allows (relative link to the code or just a mention if linking is awkward in a printed context).
     - In the Planning or wherever, note that this concept now has a support example. This is optional but keeps instructional materials connected.

9. **Double-Check Style and Conventions:**
   - Open the example code one more time and ensure:
     - All naming follows conventions (e.g., if you introduced a helper method, did you name it in PascalCase? local variables in camelCase? Constants in ALL_CAPS? etc., as per style guide:contentReference[oaicite:40]{index=40}).
     - The code is formatted consistently (no mixed tabs/spaces, blank lines where appropriate for readability, no trailing spaces).
     - Comments are present where they would aid understanding, and none of the comments are misleading or outdated after any code changes.
     - Remove any leftover code that isn’t needed for illustrating the concept (maybe you had extra debug prints while testing – if they don’t serve an explanatory purpose, clean them up).

10. **Test on a Clean Environment (Optional):**
    - If possible, run the example on another machine or after doing `dotnet clean`/`dotnet run` to ensure you included all necessary files. This is mainly to confirm that if the example needed any external resource, you didn’t forget to add it to version control.
    - For instance, if you used an input file, this test would catch if you forgot to include that file in the commit.

11. **Commit the Example:**
    - Stage the new folder and its contents, along with any modifications to the Examples README or other docs.
    - Commit with a message like “Add ForLoopExample to illustrate basic for loop usage” or “Add example demonstrating file reading”.
    - Push to the repository.

12. **Notify or Document for Instructors:**
    - If working with a team, let the other instructors/content creators know a new example is available and what it demonstrates. A quick message like “I added a `ForLoopExample` in the repo – useful when teaching Week 4 loops” can prompt them to take advantage of it.
    - Over time, consider collecting feedback: if an example was particularly helpful or if it confused students, refine it.

By following this workflow, every example added will be purposeful, easy to understand, and maintained to the same standard as the rest of the course content. This ensures that our examples truly serve as a reliable resource for demonstrating concepts, and they don’t inadvertently introduce bad habits or confusion. Always remember to **keep examples simple and focused** – they are snapshots of how to do one thing right in C#, for beginners to emulate.

# RCET C# Style Guide

This directory contains the official style guide for RCET C# coursework. **All course content creators and instructors should follow these conventions when writing code** for examples, lecture demos, and assignment solutions, so that students consistently see one standard style. Likewise, students are expected to adhere to these rules in their assignments. Use this README as a quick reference for the most important style rules. For full explanations and examples, follow the links in the table of contents below.

## Quick Reference Cheat Sheet

**Formatting & Braces:**
- Always put opening and closing braces `{}` on their own lines (Allman style).
- Always use braces, even for single-line `if` or loop bodies.
- One statement and one declaration per line.
- Use blank lines to separate logical sections (e.g. between methods).
- See: [01-CodeFormatting.md](01-CodeFormatting.md)

**Indentation & Spacing:**
- Indent code blocks by 4 spaces (never tabs).
- Put a space after keywords (e.g. `if (` not `if(`).
- Never mix tabs and spaces.
- Indent continuation lines an extra 4 spaces.
- Space after commas, no extra spaces inside parentheses/brackets.
- No trailing whitespace.
- See: [02-IndentationAndSpacing.md](02-IndentationAndSpacing.md)

**Naming Conventions:**
- Use PascalCase for types, classes, public members, and methods.
- Use camelCase for local variables and parameters.
- Private fields: camelCase with a leading underscore (e.g. `_count`).
- Constants: ALL_CAPS (e.g. `MAX_RETRIES`, `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`).
- Boolean names should read like questions (e.g. `isReady`, `hasItems`).
- No Hungarian notation or type/scope prefixes except `I` for interfaces and `_` for private fields.
- Avoid abbreviations unless widely accepted.
- See: [03-NamingConventions.md](03-NamingConventions.md)

**Commenting:**
- Use `//` for short comments above the code they describe.
- Comment the "why" not the "what" — explain intent, not obvious code.
- Keep comments up to date; remove stale or misleading comments.
- Use XML comments (`/// <summary>...</summary>`) for public APIs (if any, in projects).
- No commented-out code in commits/releases.
- See: [05-Commenting.md](05-Commenting.md)

**File & Project Structure:**
- One public type per file; file name matches the type.
- Folders mirror namespaces; avoid dumping files at the root.
- Use PascalCase for all file and folder names; no spaces or underscores. Use plural folder names for collections (e.g. `Models`, `Assignments`):contentReference[oaicite:41]{index=41}.
- Keep project structure organized by feature or layer when applicable.
- See: [06-ProjectStructure.md](06-ProjectStructure.md)

**Git & GitHub:**
- Commit often with clear messages.
- Don’t commit commented-out code or personal config files.
- Use .gitignore to exclude binaries, obj/, bin/, etc.
- Branch and PR for major changes (if collaboration workflow is in place).
- See: [07-GitBestPractices.md](07-GitBestPractices.md)

### Beginner-Focused Style Guide Summary

This guide is designed for absolute beginners. Every rule is chosen for clarity and ease of understanding:
- Prefer explicit, readable code over clever or compact solutions:contentReference[oaicite:42]{index=42}. For example, it's better to write a few more lines with clear variable names than a one-liner that’s hard to read.
- Every example should compile and run as shown. If you’re writing sample code (in Topics or Examples), test it to make sure it works exactly as written.
- Console apps and simple output are preferred for learning unless the lesson is specifically about GUI. Keep I/O straightforward (no unnecessary complexity in input prompts or parsing).
- Code comments should explain the "why" behind decisions. For instance, if a loop runs 10 times, a comment might note that 10 is the problem requirement, not just restate “loop from 1 to 10”.
- Follow the folder and file structure used in this repo for all assignments and examples. For instance, if the style guide says use plural names for directories, ensure new directories you create follow that (e.g., prefer “Assignments” over “Assignment” as a folder name).
- No external packages or dependencies unless specified. Beginners should be able to run any provided code using just the .NET SDK and what’s in this repository.
- All code should run out-of-the-box using just .NET and the code in this repo. If extra steps are needed (like adding a NuGet package or changing a setting), those should be documented clearly.

**For Course Developers:** Adhering to this style guide in all your materials ensures students see a consistent coding style throughout the course. This consistency helps them internalize good practices and reduces confusion. If you find a scenario not covered by these rules, use your best judgment to stay consistent with the spirit of clarity and simplicity for beginners – or propose an addition to this guide.

For comprehensive explanations and more examples, follow the links above. All RCET C# course materials and assignments must follow these style rules to maintain consistency and professionalism.

# Workflow for Updating the Style Guide

This workflow outlines how to update or expand the style guide in a controlled and clear manner. Use these steps when you need to introduce a new rule, modify an existing rule, or clarify something in the style guide. Content creators should coordinate style changes so that all course materials remain consistent.

1. **Identify the Need for Change:** Determine exactly what you want to add or change in the style guide and why.
   - Is there a **new convention or best practice** we should adopt (e.g., a rule about using `var` vs explicit types, or async method naming)? Ensure it aligns with beginner-friendly teaching; when in doubt, prefer rules that encourage clarity for novices.
   - Did you find an **ambiguity or inconsistency** in the current guide? For example, perhaps the guide doesn’t mention file naming explicitly, or two sections could be interpreted to conflict.
   - Are you addressing a **specific issue observed** in student code or course content? E.g., many students are doing something incorrectly and a style rule could preempt that.

2. **Discuss with the Team (if applicable):** If multiple instructors or developers are involved, quickly discuss the proposed change. This can prevent unnecessary or subjective rules. Ensure the rule is truly beneficial for learning:
   - Example: You propose disallowing the use of `?:` (ternary operator) because it might confuse beginners. Other instructors agree or disagree. As a team, decide if it becomes a rule (“Avoid ternary operator in student code until they are comfortable with if/else”).
   - If no team, use your best judgment but reflect on the **principles of the guide**: clarity, consistency, beginner-friendly.

3. **Choose the Location for the Update:** Determine which file in the StyleGuide directory the change belongs in:
   - Minor tweaks to phrasing or examples might just be within the existing files.
   - A new rule about code layout might go into **04-CodeLayoutAndStructure.md** if it’s about organizing code blocks, for example.
   - A brand new category of rules (not covered by 1-7 existing docs) might need a new markdown file. If so, decide its next sequence number (e.g., 08-...md). Check the Table of Contents in README to ensure numbering stays sequential with no duplicates.
   - If adding a new file, name it with a prefix and descriptive title, e.g., `08-ErrorHandling.md` for a new section on error handling conventions, and include a heading inside like “# Error Handling”.

4. **Draft the Changes:**
   - Open the relevant Markdown file (or create a new one from the template of others).
   - Use the same format as other sections:
     - If it’s a list of bullet rules, maintain that structure.
     - Start with a short introduction if appropriate, then bullets or numbered guidelines.
     - Provide examples if needed (in code blocks with comments to illustrate wrong vs right, etc.).
   - Write the rules in a clear, imperative style (consistent with others). e.g., “Do not use var for primitive types – use the explicit type for clarity” (if that were a rule).
   - Keep explanations brief. If a rule needs more than a sentence or two to justify, consider if it’s too advanced or context-specific. However, a short rationale in parentheses or following sentence is fine.
   - For any new *term* or *concept* in the rule, consider if beginners will know it. If not, you may need to simplify the language or explain it.
   - Ensure new content doesn’t contradict existing content. If it does, you’ll need to update or remove the old content to resolve the conflict.
   - **Example of adding a rule:** Suppose we want to add a naming rule for interface names (which might be advanced, but let’s say we do). We’d open 03-NamingConventions.md, find the bullet where interface naming could fit (the style guide already mentions “prefix interfaces with I” indirectly:contentReference[oaicite:43]{index=43}, but if it didn’t, we’d add a bullet: “- Interface names should be prefixed with 'I' (e.g., `IStudentRepository`).” and maybe a brief note why.)

5. **Update the README (Quick Reference and TOC):**
   - If your change is substantive (new rule or changed rule), reflect it in the **Quick Reference Cheat Sheet** at the top of README.md:
     - Add or adjust a bullet point under the relevant section. Keep it succinct since the cheat sheet is just a summary.
     - E.g., if you added an “Error Handling” section as file 08, you might add: “**Error Handling:** Always use try/catch for file or network operations in examples; never swallow exceptions silently.”
   - Update the **Table of Contents**:
     - If a new file was created, add a numbered entry with the same format: e.g., `8. [08-ErrorHandling.md](08-ErrorHandling.md) — Error Handling`
     - Check numbering of existing entries to insert it in the right place (numerically).
     - If you changed a title of an existing file or moved content between files, adjust the TOC accordingly.
   - Review the **Beginner-Focused Summary** section:
     - Does your new rule or change need to be reflected there? That summary is a narrative form of key principles. For example, if you added a rule “Avoid multi-line LINQ queries in examples for simplicity,” you might add a line in the summary akin to “- Prefer simple loops and clear code over complex LINQ expressions for teaching purposes.”
     - If no change is needed there, that’s fine; it’s more general.

6. **Cross-Check References and Examples:**
   - If you reference external sources (like Microsoft’s conventions or any link), ensure they’re properly linked or cited. For instance, if adding a note referencing Microsoft’s naming guidelines as justification, you could add a footnote or a link in references.
   - If you include a code example snippet to illustrate a rule, run that snippet mentally or in a quick sandbox to ensure it’s correct and follows all other style rules (no point illustrating a style rule with a code snippet that breaks another rule).
   - Make sure the style guide remains internally consistent. For example, if a new rule says “always use braces” and an old example in another section didn’t (maybe oversight), fix that old example now. Or if you add a rule about `var`, ensure no existing example in style guide violates it.

7. **Proofread for Clarity and Tone:**
   - Read the modified sections as if you are a beginner or a TA checking student code. Do they make sense?
   - Ensure the tone is instructive, not scolding. The guide should say “Do X” rather than “Never ever do Y, that’s terrible” – keep it professional and focused on what to do.
   - Check spelling and grammar. Many style terms might be technical, but ensure plain English parts are correct.
   - Verify formatting: bullets, indentation in the markdown, code fences, etc., so that it will render nicely on GitHub and elsewhere.

8. **Double-Check All Links in StyleGuide:**
   - Click each link in the README Quick Reference and TOC that you edited to make sure it points to the correct section/file (especially if you added a new file or changed a filename).
   - If a new file was added, click it in GitHub preview to ensure it displays (if writing locally, maybe wait until commit to test, but you can simulate the link).
   - For any external links (like references to MS Docs), verify they are still live and relevant. If you added one, ensure it’s formatted properly with markdown.

9. **Commit the Changes:**
   - Commit each modified file (and new files) with a message like “Update Style Guide – add error handling section” or “Clarify naming conventions for interfaces in style guide.”
   - If multiple aspects were changed, consider separate commits (e.g., one commit for naming changes, one for new section) to isolate changes, but if they are related, one commit is fine.

10. **Communicate Style Changes to Team and Students:**
    - If working with others, notify them. A quick summary: “Style Guide updated: added Section 8 on error handling, and clarified interface naming. Please review and ensure our upcoming materials follow this.”
    - If this change affects how students write code (and they’ve already been coding), decide how to inform them. For example, if mid-course you introduce a new rule (“always include file headers in code”), you might want to announce it in class or put it in an assignment handout so they start doing it.
    - Update any templates or example code to reflect the changes. For instance, if you created a project template with no file header comment but now the style guide says to have one, update that template in the repo so new projects we give out comply.

By following this workflow, you ensure the style guide remains a reliable, up-to-date resource. All course content (topics, examples, assignments) should then consistently reflect these rules, making it easier for students to follow and for instructors to grade. Style changes should be infrequent and carefully considered, since consistency over time is also important – but when needed, this process helps integrate them smoothly into the course materials.

## Missing or Incomplete Items in the Project

* **Quiz and Weekly Assessment Content:** The planning notes call for a quiz each week (Mon–Thu) and an assessment each Friday, but the repository has no quiz questions or exam materials. These need to be developed (or noted if they will be handled outside the repo) to align with the course schedule.
* **Grading Rubric:** There is a to-do to convert a grading rubric to Markdown with generic and specific criteria, but no rubric file is present. A standardized rubric for console vs GUI assignments should be created so students know how they’ll be evaluated.
* **Assignment Instructions Template:** The plan mentions developing a clear assignment instructions template or guide. Currently, instructions are written individually and consistently, but there's no explicit template document. Creating one (even if just an outline in the README or a separate guide) could ensure future instructions stay uniform.
* **Project Setup Guide:** Assignment instruction files refer to a "ProjectSetup.md" for how to set up projects and version control, but this file is not found. This guide is incomplete/missing and should be created to provide students with step-by-step setup instructions (e.g., creating a new project, adding to Git, etc.).
* **Duplication of Assignment Instructions:** Some assignment folders contain their own copy of instructions (e.g., `SayMyNameInstructions.md` inside the project) in addition to the master copy in `00-AssignmentInstructions`. This duplication is flagged in the conversion notes. It should be resolved by keeping only one source of truth for each assignment’s instructions to avoid confusion.
* **"Assignments" Directory Naming:** The top-level directory is spelled "Assingments" (with an extra 's'), which contradicts the style guide's naming conventions (should use correct spelling and PascalCase). Renaming it to "Assignments" will prevent confusion and uphold standards.
* **Legacy Content Integration:** The **OldCourseContent.md** lists weekly "Time Management Quizzes" and "Professionalism Assignments" for many weeks, but the new plan/documentation doesn't address these recurring items. If these are still part of the course, content or guidelines for them are missing. The course plan should clarify whether to include these non-coding assignments and develop materials or instructions for them.
* **Topic Content Completion:** While many topic files are populated, some appear to be in draft or outline form (e.g., the "full course core topics final draft" document suggests bullet lists that may need fleshing out). Any topic that remains a skeletal outline should be expanded with full explanations, examples, and references as per the Topics workflow.
* **Learning Objectives in Topics:** The current topic files provide introductions and content but do not explicitly list learning objectives for each lesson. For stronger backward design alignment, each topic could start by stating clear objectives (what students should be able to do after learning it). Adding these would ensure content, examples, and assessments for that topic stay focused and aligned.
* **Midterm/Final Assessment Plans:** The schedule mentions a midterm in Week 8 and final assessment in Week 16, but no materials or study guides for these are in the repo. It's an incomplete area – the course would benefit from having at least an outline or review material for the midterm and final (even if the actual exams are not in the repo, a preparation guide or summary could be included for completeness).

Each of the above items will need attention to ensure the course planning project is comprehensive. Addressing these gaps will improve alignment between planned outcomes and provided materials, ensuring nothing that was planned (quizzes, rubrics, etc.) falls through the cracks during course delivery.
