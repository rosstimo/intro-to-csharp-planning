## Assignment Instructions

Create a new program based on the **Say My Name program**. Your new program should:

1. Ask the user for their name.
2. Greet the user by name on the console.
3. If the user's name is **Emily** or **Joe**, greet them with their name (e.g., "Hello, Emily!").
4. If the user's name is **your own name**, display a unique message.
5. For **all other names**, respond with the same generic message.
6. Remember to include the standard program information header in your code.
