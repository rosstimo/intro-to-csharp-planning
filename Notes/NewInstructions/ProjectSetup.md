# Project Setup Instructions

For each assignment, follow these steps to set up your C# project and version control:

1. Create a new C# project with the specified assignment name (e.g., **HelloWorld**).
   - **Using Visual Studio?** See the [Visual Studio Beginner Guide](./VisualStudio_Create_Run_CSharp.md)
   - **Using VS Code?** See the [VS Code Beginner Guide](./VSCode_Create_Run_CSharp.md)
2. Initialize a new git repository in your project directory.
3. Create a remote repository on GitHub and link it to your local repository.
4. Make an initial commit with your project files and push to GitHub.
5. Add the standard program information header to your code. For example, your header should include:
   - Your name
   - Course number
   - Semester
   - Program name
   - Repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/yourusername/HelloWorld.git`)
6. Commit the header addition and push to GitHub.
7. Commit your changes periodically and at appropriate milestones as you work on your code.
