## Assignment Instructions

Write a generic function to convert a string to a 32-bit integer and return the conversion status.

Your function should:
- Take two arguments: a string value to be converted, and an out integer variable to store the result.
- Return a boolean indicating if the conversion was successful.
- If successful, update the out integer variable with the converted value.
- If not, do not update the integer variable.

In your `Main` method, repeatedly prompt the user to enter a number, call your conversion function, and display whether the conversion was successful. If not, display an error message. Continue until the user chooses to exit.

Remember to include the standard program information header in your code.
