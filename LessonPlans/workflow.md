# Workflow for Creating and Updating Lesson Plans

This workflow provides a step-by-step guide for creating and updating lesson plans in the `LessonPlans/` directory. Follow these steps to ensure all lesson plans are consistent, comprehensive, and aligned with the course objectives.

## Step 1: Review the Course Schedule

- Open `Notes/Schedule.md` to identify the topic and week for which the lesson plan is being created or updated.
- Ensure you understand the learning objectives and activities planned for that week.

---

## Step 2: Create or Open the Lesson Plan File

- If creating a new lesson plan, name the file according to the topic or week (e.g., `Week01_HelloWorld.md`).
- If updating an existing lesson plan, open the corresponding file in the `LessonPlans/` directory.

## Step 3: Follow the Standard Format

Each lesson plan should include the following sections:

1. **Title and Week:** Clearly state the title of the lesson and the week it corresponds to.
2. **Learning Objectives:** List the specific skills or knowledge students should gain from the lesson.
3. **Materials Needed:** Include any resources, tools, or files required for the lesson.
4. **Lesson Outline:** Provide a detailed outline of the lesson, including:
   - Introduction: Briefly introduce the topic and its importance.
   - Activities: List the activities or exercises to be completed during the lesson.
   - Discussion Points: Include key questions or topics for class discussion.
5. **Assessment:** Describe how student understanding will be assessed (e.g., quizzes, assignments, in-class exercises).
6. **References:** Include links to relevant resources, such as official documentation or additional reading materials.

## Step 5: Test and Review

- Test any activities or exercises included in the lesson plan to ensure they are clear and achievable within the lesson timeframe.
- Review the lesson plan for clarity, consistency, and alignment with the course objectives.

## Step 6: Save and Commit

- Save the lesson plan file and preview it in a Markdown viewer to confirm formatting.
- Commit your changes with a clear message, e.g., “Add Week 5 lesson plan on File I/O.”
- Push the commit to the repository.

## Notes for Instructors

- Use the lesson plans as a guide, but adapt them as needed to fit your teaching style and the needs of your students.
- Share feedback and suggestions for improving lesson plans with the course development team.
