# Workflow for Creating and Updating Examples

This workflow provides a step-by-step guide for creating and updating examples in the `Examples/` directory. Follow these steps to ensure all examples are clear, functional, and aligned with the course content.

---

## Step 1: Identify the Need for an Example

- Review the course schedule, lesson plans, and assignments to identify where examples are needed.
- Determine the purpose of the example (e.g., illustrating a concept, supporting an assignment, or enhancing a lesson).

---

## Step 2: Create or Open the Example File

- If creating a new example, name the file descriptively (e.g., `LoopsExample.cs`, `FileIOExample.cs`).
- If updating an existing example, open the corresponding file in the `Examples/` directory.

---

## Step 3: Write or Update the Example

- **Keep It Simple:** Write clear, beginner-friendly code that avoids unnecessary complexity.
- **Comment the Code:** Use comments to explain key concepts and steps in the example.
- **Test the Code:** Run the example to ensure it is functional and error-free.

---

## Step 4: Add Supporting Materials (if needed)

- Include any necessary images, diagrams, or other resources to support the example.
- Save images in the `Images/` subdirectory with descriptive filenames (e.g., `LoopsDiagram.png`).

---

## Step 5: Align with Course Content

- Ensure the example aligns with the corresponding topic in the `Topics/` directory.
- Verify that any assignments or lessons referencing the example are consistent with its content.

---

## Step 6: Save and Commit

- Save the example file and preview it in a text editor or IDE to confirm formatting.
- Commit your changes with a clear message, e.g., “Add example for loops in C#.”
- Push the commit to the repository.

---

## Notes for Contributors

- Test all examples thoroughly before adding them to the directory.
- Use consistent naming conventions and file organization.
- Keep the directory organized and up-to-date with the course content.

## Final Word

By following this workflow, you ensure that all examples are clear, functional, and aligned with the overall course objectives. This helps maintain a high standard of teaching and supports student success.
