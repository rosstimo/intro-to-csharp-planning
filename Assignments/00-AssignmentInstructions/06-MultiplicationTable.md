## Assignment Instructions

Create a program that displays a multiplication table for numbers 1 through 12. Your program should:

1. Use nested loops to generate and display the multiplication table.
2. Format the output so the table is easy to read and **aligned**.
3. Optionally, allow the user to specify the size of the table (default to 12x12 if not specified).
4. Wait for the user to press Enter before closing the console window.
5. Remember to include the standard program information header in your code.
