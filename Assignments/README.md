# Assignments

This directory contains all the assignments for the Intro to C# course. Each assignment is designed to reinforce the concepts covered in the corresponding week of the course schedule. Assignments are organized into subdirectories, each named and numbered according to the course week and topic.

## Structure

- **00-AssignmentInstructions/**: Contains detailed instructions for each assignment. These are written in Markdown and are meant to be student-facing.
- **XX-AssignmentName/**: Each assignment has its own folder, named and numbered according to the course week and topic. For example:
  - `01-HelloWorld/`: Contains the project files for the "Hello World" assignment.
  - `02-SayMyName/`: Contains the project files for the "Say My Name" assignment.

## Purpose

The `Assignments` directory is the workspace for creating, testing, and refining assignment instructions, rubrics, and example solutions. It serves multiple purposes:

1. **Instruction Development:** Each assignment includes detailed, beginner-friendly instructions that guide students through the task. These instructions are written and refined here to ensure clarity and alignment with the course topics.

2. **Rubric Creation:** Rubrics for grading assignments are developed alongside the instructions to ensure consistent and fair evaluation criteria.

3. **Code Validation:** The C# code in this directory represents the refined version of how the assignment should be completed by a student. It is written to reflect the skills and concepts students have learned up to that point in the course.

4. **Testing for Clarity:** The code is used to validate that the instructions are clear, comprehensive, and achievable for students. If the code cannot be written based on the instructions, the instructions are revised.

By maintaining this directory, we ensure that assignments are not only effective learning tools but also realistic and achievable for students at their current level of understanding.

## Guidelines for Contributors

When creating or updating assignments, follow these guidelines:

1. **Alignment with Topics:** Ensure each assignment aligns with the topics covered in the corresponding week. For example, if Week 3 covers basic operators, the assignment should focus on applying those operators.
2. **Beginner-Friendly:** Write instructions and code that are clear and easy to understand for absolute beginners. Avoid advanced concepts unless explicitly required.
3. **Consistency:** Follow the style and formatting rules outlined in the `StyleGuide/` directory. Cite specific style guide files when necessary.
4. **Testing:** Test all assignment code to ensure it compiles and runs as expected. Include sample input and output where applicable.
5. **Documentation:** Update the `00-AssignmentInstructions/` folder with clear, detailed instructions for each assignment. Include links to relevant topic files and official .NET documentation.
