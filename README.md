# Intro to C# Planning (Course Content Creation Repo)

This repository is for **designing and building** a beginner-level C# programming course. It replaces the previous VB.NET version taught at RCET. This is **not** the final course content students will see‚Äîit's the **staging ground** where instructors, assistants, and AI collaborators plan, write, test, and organize all materials before they‚Äôre published to students.

The target audience for this repo is **course content creators**. Everything here exists to help you create consistent, high-quality instructional content aligned with the course learning objectives.

## üß† Project Purpose

- Build a beginner-friendly, modern C# programming course using console and GUI apps
- Follow best practices in curriculum design (backward design, scaffolded skills, consistent assessment)
- Maintain clear structure and style across all assignments, topics, examples, and instructions
- Use GitHub for version control, collaboration, and source of truth for all course artifacts
