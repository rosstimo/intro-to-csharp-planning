## 11. Loops

- **Types of Loops:**
  - `for` loop: When you know how many times
  - `while` loop: Repeat as long as a condition is true
  - `do-while` loop: Always runs at least once

- **Loop Control:**
  - `break` (exit loop early), `continue` (skip to next iteration)
  - Nested loops: Just enough to understand tables and grids; warn about complexity

- **Common Mistakes:**
  - Off-by-one errors (classic)
  - Infinite loops (forgot to update your condition)

- **Real Tasks:**
  - Counting, summing, searching, table generation

- **Why it Matters:**
  - Loops let you process data, automate repetitive work, and make useful programs
