## 18. Professionalism, Documentation & Habits

- **Commenting:**
  - Use comments to explain intent (the “why”), not the obvious (the “what”)
  - File headers: author, course, assignment, date
  - Method summaries (`/// <summary>...</summary>`)

- **Git & Version Control:**
  - Commit early, commit often—don’t lose your work
  - Write clear commit messages: what changed and why
  - Push to GitHub as backup and for instructor review

- **Assignment Submission:**
  - Follow naming, file, and repo structure instructions exactly
  - Submit via Canvas/GitHub link as required

- **Rubric Adherence:**
  - Read rubrics before you start coding
  - Double-check all requirements before submitting

- **Documentation & Help:**
  - Always check MSDN/docs for any new class/method
  - Ask for help the right way: show your error, what you tried, and what you expected

- **Why it Matters:**
  - Pro skills = fewer lost assignments, faster help, happier instructor, better grades
  - Documentation is a lifesaver for future you and your team
