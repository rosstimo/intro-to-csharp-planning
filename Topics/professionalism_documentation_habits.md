# Professionalism, Documentation & Habits in C#

## Introduction

Professional habits and good documentation make your code easier to understand, maintain, and share. They help you avoid mistakes, get help faster, and succeed in your course and career. This section covers commenting, version control, assignment submission, rubrics, and how to ask for help.

---

**Commenting:**
- Use comments to explain intent (the “why”), not the obvious (the “what”)
- File headers: author, course, assignment, date
- Method summaries (`/// <summary>...</summary>`)
- Example:
  ```csharp
  // Author: Sheila
  // Assignment: Hello World
  // Date: 2025-07-23
  /// <summary>
  /// Prints a greeting to the console.
  /// </summary>
  void SayHello()
  {
      Console.WriteLine("Hello!");
  }
  ```

**Git & Version Control:**
- Commit early, commit often—don’t lose your work
- Write clear commit messages: what changed and why
- Push to GitHub as backup and for instructor review

---

**Assignment Submission:**
- Follow naming, file, and repo structure instructions exactly
- Submit via Canvas/GitHub link as required

---

**Rubric Adherence:**
- Read rubrics before you start coding
- Double-check all requirements before submitting

---

**Documentation & Help:**
- Always check MSDN/docs for any new class/method
- Ask for help the right way: show your error, what you tried, and what you expected

---

**Why it Matters:**
- Pro skills = fewer lost assignments, faster help, happier instructor, better grades
- Documentation is a lifesaver for future you and your team

---

**Practical:**
- Practice writing clear comments and method summaries.
- Use version control (Git) for all your projects.
- Check rubrics and requirements before submitting assignments.
- Ask for help with clear, complete information.
