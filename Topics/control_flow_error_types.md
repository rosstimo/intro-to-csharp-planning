## 9. Control Flow & Error Types

- **Conditionals:**
  - `if`, `else if`, `else`—decision-making in code
  - `switch` statement for multi-way choice (keep examples simple)
  - Boolean logic: `&&`, `||`, `!`—combine/negate conditions
  - Ternary operator (`? :`)—show, but not required

- **Why Flat, Not Deep?**
  - Avoid “pyramid of doom” (deeply nested if/else)
  - Write code that’s easy to read and debug

- **Types of Errors:**
  - Compiler errors: C# won’t even run your code (syntax, type, missing stuff)
  - Exceptions: Code crashes at runtime (divide by zero, null, out of bounds)
  - Logic errors: Code runs, but does the wrong thing (off-by-one, bad math)
  - Style/convention violations: Code works, but it’s ugly, unreadable, or against class rules

- **Practical:**
  - Show examples of each error type
  - Make students fix logic errors, not just “get it to run”
