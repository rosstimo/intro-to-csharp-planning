- **Design Patterns:**
  - MVC, MVVM, Singleton, Factory, etc.

- **Complex Serialization:**
  - JSON, XML, binary object persistence (beyond a basic demo)

- **Networking & Web APIs:**
  - HTTP clients, REST APIs, sockets, web programming

- **Database Programming:**
  - SQL, Entity Framework, connecting to and querying databases

- **FileSystemWatcher:**
  - Reacting to live file changes/events

- **Custom Controls & Advanced WinForms/UI:**
  - Owner-drawn controls, drag-and-drop, custom rendering

- **Live Graphics/Game Loops:**
  - GDI+ animation at game-level, real-time rendering

- **Command Line Arguments:**
  - Only demoed if time permits, not a requirement

- **Exception Throwing (`throw`):**
  - Creating and raising your own exceptions intentionally

- **Advanced Access Modifiers:**
  - `protected internal`, `private protected`, internal visibility across assemblies

**If you want to learn these, take the advanced class, or come to office hours and I’ll show you what hell really looks like.**
