## 1. Tools, Setup & Workflow

- **Visual Studio:**
  - Download, install, and update. Community Edition is fine.
  - Configure basic settings: color scheme, fonts, line numbers, autosave, and how to not break your install.
  - Know the interface: Solution Explorer, Output window, Error List, Toolbox.
  - Use the damn shortcuts: F5 (Run), F10 (Step Over), F11 (Step Into), Ctrl+K, Ctrl+C (comment).

- **Creating Projects:**
  - Start a new Console App (pick .NET 6+), pick sensible names.
  - Create a new Windows Forms App (for GUIs).
  - Understand project, solution, file structure.

- **Git & GitHub:**
  - Install Git for Windows (or use built-in in VS).
  - Create local repositories, stage/commit, and push to remote (GitHub).
  - Clone, fork, and pull—know how to back up your code and not lose your work.
  - Solve the classic “my repo is borked” student problem.

- **IDE Habits:**
  - Set, hit, and clear breakpoints.
  - Step through code, use watches and locals to inspect variables.
  - Use Find All References, Go To Definition (F12), and Quick Actions (Ctrl+.) to move at speed.

- **Documentation:**
  - Use F1 and “Go to online docs” to survive.
  - Know where to find C# docs, MSDN, StackOverflow, and GitHub issues.
  - Get into the habit of reading error messages and documentation before asking for help.
