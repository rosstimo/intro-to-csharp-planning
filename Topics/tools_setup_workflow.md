# Tools, Setup & Workflow for C# Beginners

## Introduction

Setting up your tools and workflow is the first step to success in C#. This section covers installing Visual Studio, using Git, creating projects, and building good habits for working efficiently and safely.

---

**Visual Studio:**
- Download, install, and update. Community Edition is free and works great.
- Configure basic settings: color scheme, fonts, line numbers, autosave.
- Know the interface: Solution Explorer, Output window, Error List, Toolbox.
- Use shortcuts: F5 (Run), F10 (Step Over), F11 (Step Into), Ctrl+K, Ctrl+C (comment).

---

**Creating Projects:**
- Start a new Console App (.NET 6+ recommended), pick sensible names.
- Create a new Windows Forms App for GUIs.
- Understand project, solution, and file structure.

---

**Git & GitHub:**
- Install Git (or use built-in in VS).
- Create local repositories, stage/commit, and push to remote (GitHub).
- Clone, fork, and pull—know how to back up your code and not lose your work.
- Solve common student problems with repos.

---

**IDE Habits:**
- Set, hit, and clear breakpoints.
- Step through code, use watches and locals to inspect variables.
- Use Find All References, Go To Definition (F12), and Quick Actions (Ctrl+.) to move faster.

---

**Documentation:**
- Use F1 and “Go to online docs” to survive.
- Know where to find C# docs, MSDN, StackOverflow, and GitHub issues.
- Get in the habit of reading error messages and documentation before asking for help.

---

**Practical:**
- Practice creating a new project and exploring the IDE.
- Set up a Git repository and make your first commit.
- Try using breakpoints and stepping through code.
