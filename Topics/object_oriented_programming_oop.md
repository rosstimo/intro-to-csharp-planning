## 14. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- **Classes & Objects:**
  - Blueprint (`class`), real thing (`object`)
  - Fields, properties, methods; creating new objects with `new`

- **Constructors:**
  - Special methods to set up new objects
  - Default and parameterized constructors

- **Static vs. Instance:**
  - Static members belong to the class, not any object

- **Namespaces & Fully Qualified Names:**
  - Organize code, prevent conflicts, tie to folders/files
  - Use `Project.ClassName` to disambiguate

- **File/Project Structure:**
  - One class per file, folders map to namespaces
  - Solution, project, file hierarchy in Visual Studio

- **Access Modifiers:**
  - `public`, `private`, `protected`, `internal`, `protected internal`, `private protected`
  - "Who can touch your stuff"—focus on public/private for intro, explain with analogies

- **Inheritance:**
  - `: BaseClass`, derived classes inherit fields/methods
  - Use `base` to access parent stuff
  - When to use (code reuse, logic), when not to (don’t just inherit everything)
  - Simple overrides: `virtual`, `override` for methods

- **Class Libraries:**
  - Reusable collections of classes/methods; how to create, reference, and use

- **Partial Classes:**
  - Used by Visual Studio designer to split GUI and logic

- **Not Covered Yet:**
  - Interfaces, abstract classes—mention for curiosity, do in advanced

- **Why it Matters:**
  - OOP is how you build real, maintainable, and understandable programs
  - Good OOP = less pain when your projects grow
