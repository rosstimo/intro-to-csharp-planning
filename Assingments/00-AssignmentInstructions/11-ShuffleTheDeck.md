## Assignment Instructions

Write a program that deals a card from a standard deck of 52 playing cards.

- The card should be a random suit (spades, clubs, hearts, diamonds) and value (2-10, J, Q, K, A).
- Use a multidimensional array to track if the card has already been dealt. If so, draw another random card.
- Shuffle the deck when there are no more cards left or anytime the user chooses.

Remember to include the standard program information header in your code.
